All packages currently track quickshell's master branch. This may change in the future.

# Nix
The Quickshell repo has an embedded flake.
You can use either `git+https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/quickshell`
or `github:quickshell-mirror/quickshell`.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    quickshell = {
      url = "git+https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/quickshell";

      # THIS IS IMPORTANT
      # Mismatched system dependencies will lead to crashes and other issues.
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
}
```

The package is available as `quickshell.packages.<system>.default`, which you can add to
`environment.systemPackages` or `home.packages` if you use home-manager.

> The AUR gives us no way to actually fix this, but Quickshell will attempt to
> warn you if it detects a breakage when updating. If warned of a breakage,
> please reinstall the package
